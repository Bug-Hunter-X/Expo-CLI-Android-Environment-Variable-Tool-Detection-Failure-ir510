# Expo CLI Android Environment Variable/Tool Detection Failure

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI to build Android applications. The problem stems from the Expo CLI's inability to correctly identify or access the necessary Android SDK components or environment variables.

This can manifest in various ways, often resulting in cryptic error messages during the build process. The root cause usually lies in an improperly configured Android SDK, an incompatibility between the expected SDK version and the one installed, or missing environment variables.

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified example showcasing how an application build might fail due to this error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides solutions to address this problem and get your Expo Android builds working correctly.  Note:  These solutions may require specific actions on your system, depending on your development environment.
