This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is unable to correctly detect or access the necessary Android environment variables or tools. This often happens when the Android SDK is not properly configured or when there's a mismatch between the expected SDK version and the one installed on your system.  The error message itself might not pinpoint the exact cause, making debugging challenging.
