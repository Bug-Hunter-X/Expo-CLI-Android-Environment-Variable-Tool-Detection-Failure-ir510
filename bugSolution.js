The solution involves meticulously verifying your Android SDK setup. 

**1. Verify Android SDK Installation:**

* Ensure the Android SDK is installed and correctly configured.
* Check for the presence of the necessary build tools, platform-tools, and Android SDK platforms.

**2. Environment Variable Check:**

* Confirm that `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variables are correctly set to point to your Android SDK installation directory.  On Linux/macOS, you can add these to your shell's configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.). On Windows, set them as system environment variables.

**3. SDK Manager Check:**

* Open the Android SDK Manager (usually accessed through the Android Studio SDK Manager or command-line tools). 
* Verify you have the required SDK platforms and build-tools installed.
* Make sure that the SDK's command-line tools are installed and accessible via your system's PATH environment variable.  You'll likely need to add the path to the platform-tools and build-tools subdirectories to your PATH.

**4. Clean and Rebuild:**

* After making any changes to the Android SDK configuration, always clean the Expo project using `expo prebuild --clean` and then attempt to build again using `expo build:android`. 

**5. Restart your system:**

* If none of the steps above work, it may help to simply restart your computer to ensure that any changes to environment variables are picked up by the Expo CLI.
